  <h1>How do Chinese and American gamers compare?</h1>
  <p>I made a venn diagram to compare gamers in China to gamers in America.
    <br>I'm a PC gamer with a nintendo switch as well, and all of this venn diagram is based purely on
    <br>my prior experience as a gamer online.
    <br>I hope you find this insightful!</p>
  <img style="border-radius:5%;"src="culturalcomparison.png">
  <p>Outside of this, I've got a few other observations. 
    <br>Firstly, over here there is a conception of Chinese gamers that they are super skilled at any game.
    <br>Kind of like, "Americans play for fun without learning the game, and Chinese people have fun by refining their ability to play the game."
    <br>There's some times when you are playing in a lobby online in Counter Strike or something and there is a player with chinese characters in their username
    <br>that is wiping the whole lobby like they're crumbs on a tablecloth.
    <br>In eSports, North America is most dominant in sports games and shooting games.
    <br>China is generally excellent internationally for their skill in strategy games.
