  <h1>Complex Chinese Characters</h1>
  <h2>This page is about three characters that I had a tough time with.</h2>

  <p>I've mostly struggled with <strong>换，鞋，& 懂。</strong>
    <br>换 means to change, or switch.
    <br>鞋 is the word for shoe, or shoes.
    <br>懂 is word for understand.
    <br>Here's how I overcame my difficulties with these characters!</p>
  <h1>种</h1>
  <p>My issue with 换 was I could never recall its pronunciation.
    <br>For some reason, it was more difficult with this one than 90 percent of other characters. 
    <br>I had this same issue with 种。
    <br>Using the Ankidroid app was hugely helpful. After doing Ankidroid for 3 days, I got a good hold on it.</p>

  <h1>鞋</h1>
  <p>With 鞋, I kept mixing it up with 裤, and it was annoying to write.
    <br>I overcame this with practice.
    <br>I wrote it repeatedly, on my hand with my finger, in my head, and in the assigned writing.
    <br>Every time that I wrote it, I would say it aloud and recall what it meant.
    <br>My friends got a little annoyed with me because I was doing this repeatedly. Lol.</p>
