        <br>Saturday, December 03
        <br>Today, I go shopping with my sister.
        <br>She wanted to buy a white jacket.
        <br>I didn't want to buy anything.
        <br>At noon, I drove her to the MOA.
        <br>We walked the MOA for three hours.
        <br>She didn't like the coats the stores had.
        <br>We ate lunch, and then went home at 5:00 in the evening.
